- **Home Page**: Dashboard with quick access to important hotel management sections.
- **Users Management**: Admins can view, add, edit, and delete users.
- **Bookings Management**: View and manage guest bookings.
- **Rooms Management**: Admins can manage the list of hotel rooms.
- **Reviews Management**: View guest reviews and feedback.
- **Gallery Management**: Manage hotel images displayed in the gallery.
- **Settings**: Configure hotel settings, such as preferences and configuration options.
- **Messages**: View and manage incoming messages from guests.

## Installation 💻

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-cms.git
cd hotel-cms
npm install
```

# Prerequisites 🛠️

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm: The package manager that comes with Node.js.

# Usage 📑
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

bash
```
npm start
```
This will launch the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000. You can now interact with the Hotel CMS.

# Structure of the Application 🏗️

- LoginPage: A login form where admins can enter their credentials to access the CMS.
- Layout: A layout component that wraps all the pages that require navigation and common UI elements.

# Pages:

- Home: The dashboard view of the hotel with quick links to various sections.
- Users: Displays all users (e.g., hotel staff) with options to manage them.
- Bookings: Displays and manages guest bookings.
- Rooms: Displays and manages rooms available in the hotel.
- Reviews: Displays guest reviews for the hotel.
- Gallery: Displays images of the hotel in a gallery format.
- Settings: Configuration options for the hotel.
- Messages: Displays messages from guests.

# Routing 🚦
The app uses React Router to manage different routes:
```
/: Login page.
/home: Hotel management dashboard.
/users: Users management page.
/bookings: Bookings management page.
/rooms: Rooms management page.
/reviews: Reviews management page.
/gallery: Gallery management page.
/settings: Settings page.
/messages: Messages from guests.
```

Routing Example
The following is how routes are structured:

jsx
```
<Route path="/" element={<LoginPage />} />
<Route path="/home" element={<Layout><Home /></Layout>} />
<Route path="/users" element={<Layout><Users /></Layout>} />
<Route path="/bookings" element={<Layout><Bookings /></Layout>} />
<Route path="/rooms" element={<Layout><Rooms /></Layout>} />
<Route path="/reviews" element={<Layout><Reviews /></Layout>} />
<Route path="/gallery" element={<Layout><Gallery /></Layout>} />
<Route path="/settings" element={<Layout><Settings /></Layout>} />
<Route path="/messages" element={<Layout><Messages /></Layout>} />
```
# Layout Component
The Layout component wraps all pages (except the login page) to provide consistent UI elements, such as the navigation bar and footer.

# Deployment 🌐
For production deployment, you can build the app using:

bash
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a build folder with static files that you can deploy to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
